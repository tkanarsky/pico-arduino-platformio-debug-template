# Pico-Arduino Picoprobe Debug Template
A template PlatformIO project for debugging projects using the community Pico-Arduino core using the Picoprobe SWD adapter

Arduino-Pico is an alternative PlatformIO core for the RP2040 microcontroller series which is based on top of the C/C++ SDK for RP2040, instead of the Mbed OS like the official core. 

This repository contains a minimal reproducible project for setting up build, deploy, and debug of a Arduino-Pico based project using the Picoprobe SWD debugger.

Note that this was tested only on a Pi Pico, some tweaks might be necessary for it to work with other RP2040-based boards
